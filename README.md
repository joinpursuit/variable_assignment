## Problem One

Age Calculator:
 * Store your birth year in a variable.
 let age = 1991;
 * Store a future year in a variable.
 let futureYear = 2022;
 * Calculate your 2 possible ages for that year based on the stored values.
 
 * For example, if you were born in 1988, then in 2026 you'll be either 37 or 38, depending on what month it is in 2026.
 * Log them to the screen like so: "I will be either `ageMin` or `ageMax` in `futureYear`", substituting the values.

## Problem Two

Snack Supply Calculator:
 * Store your current age in a variable.
 let currentAge = 28;
 * Store a maximum age in a variable.
 let maxAge = 70;
 * Store an estimated snack amount per day (as a number).
 let estimatedSnackAmount = 4;
 * Calculate how many snacks you would eat total, from your current age until the maximum age.
61320 snacks
 * Log the result to the screen like this: "You will need `snackNumber` to last you until the age of `maxAge`".

## Problem Three

Calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions [here]( ).
 * Store a radius into a variable.
 let radius = 9;
 * Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and log "The circumference is `circumferenceResult`".
56.548667764616276
 * Calculate the area based on the radius, and log "The area is `areaOfCircle`".

## Problem Four

Temperature Converter:
 * Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
 let celcius = 5;
 * Convert it to fahrenheit and output "`tempInCelcius`째C is `tempInFahrenheit`째F".
 let cInF = (c * 1.8) + 41;
 * Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
 let f = 41;
 * Convert it to celsius and output "`tempInFahrenheit`째F is `tempInCelcius`째C."
let fInC = (f - 41) / 1.8;

## Problem Five

Grades Calculator:
 * Store Alices's grade on a test to a variable
 let aliceGrade = 70
 * Store Bob's grade on a test to a variable
 let bobGrade = 80
 * Store Cam's grade on a test to a variable
 let camGrade = 90
 * Find the average grade of all students
let avgGradeAbc = 
 * Store Dee's grade on a test to a variable
 let dGrade = 100
 * Find the average grade of all students
 * Print out if Dee's grade is higher than the class average

## Problem Six: Predict the output

For this section write what you think will be logged as a comment next to `console.log` like so: `console.log('Cat') //'Cat'` before running the code. Then execute your file and compare with your prediction.

a. 
    ```js
    let num1 = 2
    let num2 = 5
    let num3 = num1 * num2
    console.log(num3) // console.log(10)
    ```

b. 
    ```js
    let str = 'jel' 
    str += 'lo'
    console.log(str) // console.log('jello')
    ```

c. 
    ```js
    let string =  'My favorite number is ';
    let number = 42
    let sentence = string + number
    console.log(typeof(sentence)) // console.log(string)
    ```
